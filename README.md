# RETRIEVING-SPECIFIC-DATA-USING-SELECT-CLAUSE
SQL INTERN TASK 3- SELECTIVE DATA RETRIEVIAL FROM A DATABASE

#Objective-
The goal of this task was to understand and implement SQL `SELECT` queries to retrieve, filter, and sort data from a table. This forms a fundamental part of working with relational databases, and is critical for both backend development and data analysis.

#Tools Used-
- MySQL Workbench (Primary)

#What I Did (lets get going...)-
For this task, I created an `Employees` table and inserted entries using common Indian names with recent joining dates in **June 2025** to make the data feel realistic and culturally relevant. Here I explored and implemented a variety of SQL operations that help fetch and display only the required data based on specific conditions. Here's what I covered:

- **`SELECT*` and column-specific selection** – To view all or selected fields from the table
- **`WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`** – To apply filters and combine multiple conditions
- **`LIKE`** – For pattern-based search (e.g., names starting with ‘A’)
- **`BETWEEN`** – To fetch values between a specific range (like salary bands)
- **`ORDER BY`** – For sorting the data either ascending or descending
- **`LIMIT`** – To restrict the number of results returned, such as showing the latest 3 joined employees

This task wasn’t just about syntax. It gives a solid understanding of how SQL lets you *ask smart questions from your data*, whether it's for reporting, analytics, or application development.

#Key SQL Queries Implemented:
- Retrieve all employee records
- Filter by department or salary
- Search using pattern match (`LIKE`)
- Range queries using `BETWEEN`
- Sort salaries in ascending/descending order
- Get the latest 3 joined employees using `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`
